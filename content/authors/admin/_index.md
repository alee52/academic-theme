      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University. My current research includes the theoretical analysis of models in elasticity and the theoretical analysis of the Finite Element Method in elasticity. I am particularly interested in the interface between partial differential equations (PDEs) and machine learning. Additionally, I work on several personal projects in data science.
